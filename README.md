Developing dense, convolution, and transformer neural networks to solve stencil IQ tests. 
'Sheets' of colored 'paper' with different shapes cut out of them (Triange, Square, Rhombus, Circle) to create stencils.
These stencils are stacked on top of each other to create new, composite shapes. 
The neural networks' goal is to determine which stencils were stacked in which order to create the composite shape.
